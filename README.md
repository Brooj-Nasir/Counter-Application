# Counter Application

## Overview

Welcome to the **Counter Application**! This simple yet functional C++ console application demonstrates the backend functionality of a basic counter.It describes the basic mechanism that is implemented in Counters. The program increments a counter each time the user inputs a specific character ('A') and exits the program when another specific character ('Q') is entered. This basic mechanism can be extended to various practical applications where counters are used.

## Features

- **Increment Counter**: The counter increments by 1 each time the user inputs the character 'A'.
- **Exit Program**: The program exits gracefully when the user inputs the character 'Q'.
- **Real-time Display**: The current value of the counter is displayed in real-time as it increments.
- **User-friendly Input**: Simple character-based input to control the counter and exit the program.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program in your preferred C++ development environment or compile and run it using your terminal/command prompt.
2. **Increment the Counter**: Enter the character 'A' to increment the counter. The updated counter value will be displayed.
3. **Exit the Program**: Enter the character 'Q' to exit the program. A farewell message will be displayed before the program terminates.
